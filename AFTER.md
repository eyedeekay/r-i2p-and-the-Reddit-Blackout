After the Blackout: [r/i2p](https://reddit.com/r/i2p) Moving Forward
========================================

It's been a good run folks but if Reddit's willing to tank third-party apps they're willing to tank our community, so it's time to go.
r/i2p will continue to operate for at least another year, possibly longer, but we'll be promoting ways to decentralize the power of reddit and promote anonymous and pseudonymous social news aggregators.

Our foremost discussion forum for I2P development and I2P application development has always been [i2pforum.i2p](http://i2pforum.i2p).

`lemmy`
-------

As you can see above, **[Ramble]** is primarily a forum for I2P users, as it's only writable access point is through I2P.
If you need a clear-net social news aggregator, we suggest you find a `lemmy` instance and join us in the `lemmy` I2P community.
At this time [lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml) is overloaded with reddit refugees, please consider an alternative `lemmy` instance.
Other ActivityPub based services which federate with `lemmy` are capable of communicating with `lemmy`, allowing instances to act a decentralized community.

### Lemmy is a federated service with separate "instances" available here:

 - [`lemmy` has a list of active and recommended instances here](https://join-lemmy.org/instances)
