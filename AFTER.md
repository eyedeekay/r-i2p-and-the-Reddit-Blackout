After the Blackout: [r/i2p](https://reddit.com/r/i2p) Moving Forward
========================================

It's been a good run folks but if reddit.com's willing to tank third-party apps they're willing to tank our community, so it's time to go.
[r/i2p](https://reddit.com/r/i2p) will continue to operate for at least another year, possibly longer, but for the safety of our community, we'll be promoting ways to decentralize the power of reddit.com and promote anonymous and pseudonymous social news aggregators.
This means that those of you who want to join us through reddit.com will still get your questions answered, but we'll be making a greated(and conscientious) effort to move discussions to alternative platforms and get reddit.com users onto other platforms.
Should you wish to follow along with a read-only version of r/i2p, please consider using [http://teddit.i2p, a.k.a. IncogSnoo](http://teddit.i2p) as a user-respecting read-only reddit.com gateway.

### `lemmy`

```
As you can see above, [Ramble] is primarily a forum for I2P users, as it's only writable access point is through I2P.
If you need a clear-net social news aggregator, we suggest you find a `lemmy` instance and join us in the `lemmy` I2P community.
At this time lemmy.ml is overloaded with reddit.com refugees, please consider an alternative `lemmy` instance.
Other ActivityPub based services which federate with `lemmy` are capable of communicating with `lemmy`, allowing instances to act a decentralized community.
```

#### `Lemmy is a federated service with separate "instances" available here:`
