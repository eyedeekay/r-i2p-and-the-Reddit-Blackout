# r-i2p-and-the-Reddit-Blackout

r/SaveThirdPartyApps Reddit Blackout Post somewhere we can't be spezzed out of existence.

Since I started moderating this sub almost 7 years ago, it has been my assumption that Reddit.com has the potential to be a few things. It could be a place where we reach out to members of other communities, where we build connections and grow the network by talking to people who aren't already part of our ingroup, learning about their ideas and sharing our own. At it's best, this is what reddit.com has to offer I2P, and why I have put so much time and energy into this community. It is not a universally beloved decision among other large-scale hidden service operators, but frustrating as it may be sometimes, communities that do not connect to other communities will wither. That is why I am here.

Nonetheless, from the beginning, it has also been true that Reddit.com could become even more hostile to it's users and to our community than it was 7 years ago. As Reddit.com has become more restrictive, deceptive, and invasive, many have turned to third-party applications, such as Apollo and Redreader, to escape this hostility. Reddit.com has now proposed to take the additional hostile step of forcing those app developers to pay exorbitant prices for access to Reddit.com. This is because Reddit.com has forgotten that Reddit itself offers no value, the only value Reddit has comes from the users of Reddit. It does not come from advertising, nor does it come from the mobile app.

The value of everything that Reddit.com corporate values is entirely contingent on what you, Reddit.com users, do. Personally, I don't think you should use Reddit Mobile, and I don't think you should use new.reddit.com. Both are demonstrable spyware, and both are uselessly deficient compared to the alternatives like RedReader and old.reddit.com.

However, it is no longer adequate for us to merely protest here at r/i2p. The existing moderation team will continue for the forseeable future, at this time I consider myself to be overseeing an evacuation. We will be helping users who wish to take their I2P discussions away from Reddit.com find them more suitable homes, primarily our project forums.

During the Blackout from the 12th to the 14th, this subreddit will be limited to only technical support posts. I'll be placing the subreddit into approved-posts-only mode and manually approving technical support posts in a timely manner(with the considerable assistance of the Reddit.com API). Other posts will be allowed through when the blackout is over.

Edit: change all instances of Reddit, reddit, to Reddit.com and reddit.com
A note on the use of Reddit.com instead of simply Reddit, this is for the benefit of our friends at http://teddit.i2p, who in order to operate the mirror substitute certain phrases inline, in this case Reddit=>Incogsnoo. Thanks to the reporter who pointed this out.
